Aspects of filter logic - Design Notes

filtering returned routes to an originator

Ideally, no route should be readvertised back to its source,
  and the correct behaviour when a new route is received is to send nothing back to the source;
  otherwise, if the new best route replaces an existing route from a different source peer, then a withdraw should be sent.
Complementarily, if a route is withdrawn (rib is now empty at that prefix),
  then the withdraw is suppressed for the originating peer of the route which was removed.

The full precise logic is:
 A~( withdraw or new best route source peer) B~( empty or previous route source peer) P~(target peer) ->
   A /= P: send update
   A == P & B == P : no action *
   A == P & B == empty : no action *
   A == P & B /= P : send withdraw *
   A == withdraw  & B == P : no action *
   A == withdraw  & B /= P : send withdraw
   A == withdraw  & B == empty : invalid (no action) 

Observation / Insight
Whenever a new best route is detected the source of any of the prior RIB entry is required,
  unless the per peer state carries its own list of previously announced prefixes.
The only strictly consistent alternative behaviour is to always relay back all route updates.
A non-damaging alternative is to translate to withdrawal all updates for a peer which sourced the route.
This has the potential of generating spurious withdraw messages, and it is not clear that it would have any benefit over transparent operation.
