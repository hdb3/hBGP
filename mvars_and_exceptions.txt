MVar can become dead when the 'sender' exits.
In this case an exception is raised if an attempt is made to read the MVar which can never complete.
The code in Fifo.hs handles this.
As a side note, the exception is still raised and is shown when running with profiling etc:
the profiling is enabled in this case by using the cabal file setting in cabal.project: "profiling: True",
and at run time adding " +RTS -xc".
A general exceptin handler looks like this:

dequeueAll mvar =
  catch
    (dequeue mvar)
    ( \(e) -> do
        logTrace $ T.pack $ "unexpected exception" ++ show (e :: SomeException)
        return []
    )
